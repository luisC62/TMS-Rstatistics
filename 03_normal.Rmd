Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Problems

### Problem 1

Assume a normal standard distribution for the random variable x. Find the probability that x is greather or equal than -1.18

```{r}
# Use p for cumulative distribution
p1<-1-pnorm(-1.18, 0, 1)
sprintf("the probability of x>=-1.18 is: %f", p1)
```

### Problem 2

Assume a normal standard distribution for the random variable x. Find the probability that the value of x lies between 1.27 and -0.98.

```{r}
p2<-pnorm(1.27, 0, 1)-pnorm(-0.98, 0, 1)
sprintf("the probability of -098<x<1.27 is: %f", p2)
```

### Problem 3

Assume a normal standard distribution for the random variable x. For which value the probability of being less is 0.2206?

```{r}
# qnorm is useful to find percentiles
x3<-qnorm(0.2206, 0, 1)
sprintf("the value is: %f", x3)
```

### Problem 4

Assume a normal standard distribution for the random variable x. For which value the area on the right is 0.9251?

```{r}
# qnorm is useful to find percentiles
x4<-qnorm(1-0.9251, 0, 1)
sprintf("the value is: %f", x4)
```

## Real applications of normal distribution

### Application 1

The IQ scores of adults is distributed according a normal shape, with mean 100 and standard deviation of 15. Which is the probability that a randomly picked IQ be greater than 90?

```{r}
# Use p for cumulative distribution
a1<-1-pnorm(90, 100, 15)
sprintf("the probability of IQ>=90 is: %f", a1)
```

### Application 2

With the same distribution as in application 1, which is the probability that a randomly selected IQ lies between 106 and 126?

```{r}
a2<-pnorm(126, 100, 15)-pnorm(106, 100, 15)
sprintf("the probability of 106<IQ<126 is: %f", a2)
```

### Application 3

With the same distribution as in previous application, which is the IQ whose probability of to find any other higher value is 0.3446?

```{r}
# qnorm is useful to find percentiles
a3<-qnorm(1-0.3446, 100, 15)
sprintf("the value is: %f", a3)
```

### Application 4

The IQ scores of adults is distributed according a normal shape, with mean 97.3 and standard deviation of 19.3. Find the probability of a randomly selected IQ be higher than 129.4.

```{r}
a4<-1-pnorm(129.4, 97.3, 19.3)
sprintf("of IQ>129.4 is: %f", a4)
```

### Application 5

Engineers want to design seats in commercial aircraft so that they are wide enough to fit 90% of all males (Accommodating 100% of males would require very wide seats tat would be much too expensive). Men have hip breadths that are normally distributed with a mean of 14.2 in and a standard deviation of 1.1 in. Find the width of the seat.

```{r}
# qnorm is useful to find percentiles
x5<-qnorm(0.9, 14.2, 1.1)
sprintf("the widht of the seat is: %f in", x5)
```

### Application 6

The IQ scores of adults is distributed according a normal shape, with mean 95.5 and standard deviation of 19. Find the first quartile Q1 (separating the bottom 25%)

```{r}
# qnorm is useful to find percentiles
x6<-qnorm(0.25, 95.5, 19)
sprintf("the first quartile, Q1, is: %f", x6)
```

### Application 7

Assume that military aircraft use ejection seats designed for men weighing between 141.4 lb and 220 lb. If women's weights are normally distributed with a mean of 171.4 lb and a standard deviation of 46.9 lb, what is the percentage of women that are within those limits? Are many women excluded with those specifications?

```{r}
a7<-pnorm(220, 171.4, 46.9)-pnorm(141.4, 171.4, 46.9)
e7=1-a7
sprintf("%f%% of women can use the ejection seats", a7*100)
sprintf("%f%% are excluded", e7*100)

```

### Application 8

The lengths of pregnancies are normally distributed with a mean of 269 days and a standard deviation of 15 days. (a) Find the probability of a pregnancy lasting 309 days or longer. (b) If the length of pregnancy is the lowest 2% then the baby is premature. Find the length that separates premature babies from those who are not premature

```{r}
a8<-1-pnorm(309, 269, 15)
x8<-qnorm(0.02, 269, 15)
sprintf("(a): The probability that pregnancy lasts 309 days or longer is: %f", a8)
sprintf("(b): Below a length of pregnancy of %f days, the baby can be considered premature", x8)
```
