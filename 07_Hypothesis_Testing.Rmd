## Introduction

Hypothesis Testing is simply answer questions about a population given a sample of that. See more about general hypothesis testing in the play list by [The Math sorcerer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO1y6V1SXjjMIJ7HK2U7qFvoLpnNQfbuF)

### Null Hypothesis $H_{0}$

It is always a statement of equality. For example $\mu=100$.

### Alternate Hypothesis $H_{1}$ or $H_{A}$

Most of the time will be the actual claim. There are three cases (Examples):

1: Left tailed test: $H_{1}$: $\mu<100$.

2: Right tailed test: $H_{1}$: $\mu>100$.

3: Two tailed test: $H_{1}$: $\mu\neq100$.

### Test Statistic

It is going to be computed (using R or another software)

### p-value

It is going to be computed from the test statistic

### Level of significance $\alpha$

This is the probability to make a mistake (Reject $H_{0}$ when in fact it is true)

### Decision Making (Important)

-   If $p-value\leq\alpha$, then Reject $H_{0}$
-   If $p-value>\alpha$, then ***Fail*** to Reject $H_{0}$

### Steps for Hypothesis Testing

1.  State $H_{0}$ and $H_{1}$
2.  Compute the test statistic
3.  Compute the p-value
4.  Make a Decision: Reject $H_{0}$ or Fail to Reject $H_{0}$.
5.  Interpretation of the results

## How to Set Up the Null and Alternate Hypothesis

### Strong and Weak inequalities

-   Strong Inequalities: \>, \<, $\neq$
-   Weak Inequalities: $\geq$, $\leq$, =

Alternative hypothesis, $H_{1}$, is formulated with a strong inequality. Null hypothesis, $H_{o}$, is always formulated with the equal symbol, =

### Example 1

Claim: More than 70% of kids like chocolate.

-   Null Hypothesis: $H_{0}$: $p=0.7$

-   Alternate Hypothesis: $H_{1}$: $p>0.7$

### Example 2

Claim: The mean weight of all kangaroos is less than 200 pounds

-   Null Hypothesis: $H_{0}$: $\mu=200$

-   Alternate Hypothesis: $H_{1}$: $\mu<200$

### Example 3

Claim: The proportion of smokers is at least 80%

-   Null Hypothesis: $H_{0}$: $p=0.8$

-   Alternate Hypothesis: $H_{1}$: $p>0.8$ !!! (alternative is the opposite of the claim)

### Example 4

Claim: The percentage of Dolphins in adulthood is 75%.

-   Null Hypothesis: $H_{0}$: $p=0.75$

-   Alternate Hypothesis: $H_{1}$: $p\neq0.75$ !!!! (alternative is the opposite of the claim)

## Determine the Conclusion of the Hypothesis Test using the p-value

-   If the $p-value\leq\alpha$, then Reject $H_{0}$

-   If the $p-value>\alpha$, then Fail to Reject $H_{0}$

### Example 1

-   Null Hypothesis: $H_{0}$: $\mu=100$

-   Alternate Hypothesis: $H_{1}$: $\mu<100$

Lets say that $\alpha=0.05$ and $p-value=0.023$, then we Reject $H_{0}$. We can say: At the 5% of significance there is a sufficient evidence that mean is less than 100

### Example 2

-   Null Hypothesis: $H_{0}$: $p=.80$

-   Alternate Hypothesis: $H_{1}$: $p\neq0.80$

Lets say that $\alpha=0.01$ and $p-value=0.24$. In this case we Fail to Reject $H_{0}$. We don't have evidence to say that $H_{1}$ is true.

## How tho Determine a Conclusion of a Hypothesis Test

-   If the $p-value\leq\alpha$, then Reject $H_{0}$

-   If the $p-value>\alpha$, then Fail to Reject $H_{0}$

### Example 1

-   Null Hypothesis: $H_{0}$: $\mu=50$

-   Alternate Hypothesis: $H_{1}$: $\mu<50$

Our $\alpha=0.05$ and $p-value=0.02$. In this case we reject $H_{0}$, so there is enough evidence to support $H_{1}$

### Example 2

-   Null Hypothesis: $H_{0}$: $\mu=75$

-   Alternate Hypothesis: $H_{1}$: $\mu>75$

Our $\alpha=0.05$ and $p-value=0.24$. In this case we fail to reject $H_{0}$. We have not enough evidence to support $H_{1}$.
