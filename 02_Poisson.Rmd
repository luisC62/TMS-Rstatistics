Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Problems

### Problem 1

Last year, a person wrote 122checks. Let the random variable x reprsent the number of checks he worte in one day, and it has a Poisson distribution. What is the mean number of checks written per day?. What is the standard deviation? What is the variance?

```{r}
mu_=122/365
sd=sqrt(mu_)
va=sd^2
sprintf("Mean: %f", mu_)
sprintf("Standard deviation: %f", sd)
sprintf("Variance: %f", va)

```

### Problem 2

In a recent year, a hospital reported 4467 births. Find the mean number of births per day, then use that result and the Poisson distribution to find the probability that in a day, there are exactly 15 births.

```{r}
lamda=4467/365
p15<-dpois(15, lamda)
sprintf("The mean number of births is: %f", lamda)
sprintf("The probability of exactly 15 births is: %f", p15)

```

### Problem 3

In a recent year, an author wrote 173 checks. Use the Poisson distribution to find the probability that, on a randomly selected day, he wrote at least one check

```{r}
lamda2=173/365
p_more1<-1-dpois(0, lamda2)
sprintf("Probatility of at least 1 check witten: %f", p_more1)

```

Print a graph of this distribution

```{r}
x <- seq(0, 5, by = 1) 
y <- dpois(x, lamda2) 
plot(x, y, type = 'h') 

```

Print a graph of the cumulative Poisson distribution

```{r}
x <- seq(0, 5, by = 1) 
y <- ppois(x, lamda2) 
plot(x, y, type = 'h') 
```
